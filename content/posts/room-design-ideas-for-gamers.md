Who should use cool wallpaper?
Cool wallpaper is a great way to add a touch of elegance and style to any room. Here are five tips on how to make the most of cool wallpaper: 
1) Choose the right type of wallpaper – There are three main types of wallpapers: natural, abstract, or floral. You should consider the level of detail that will be needed for your design and how your space will look. 
2) Use the right colors – Cool wallpaper can be paired with any color scheme or pattern. If you want a more unique look, Experiment with different colors and patterns. 
3) Use cutouts or borders – Cutouts let you create a personalized look without having to buy anything extra. Borders add some structure and stability to your wallpaper and can be used in any position in your space.
