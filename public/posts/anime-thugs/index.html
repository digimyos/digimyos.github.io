While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime: -Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching. -If you’re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA’s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.\n","wordCount":"3861","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-31T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Miss Georgette Feest"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://digimyos.github.io/posts/anime-thugs/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Digimyos Wallpaper","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://digimyos.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://digimyos.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://digimyos.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://digimyos.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://digimyos.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://digimyos.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://digimyos.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Anime Thugs ~ Anime Thug Life</h1><div class=post-description>Thugs relax</div><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2023-01-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 31, 2023&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;19 min&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;3861 words&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;Miss Georgette Feest</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#thugs-by-zhao-p-on-deviantart>Thugs By Zhao-P On DeviantArt</a></li><li><a href=#anime-thug-wallpapers---wallpaper-cave>Anime Thug Wallpapers - Wallpaper Cave</a></li><li><a href=#anime-thugs---unlike-many-other-websites-animekisa-has-a-tiny-amount-of>Anime Thugs - Unlike Many Other Websites Animekisa Has A Tiny Amount Of</a></li><li><a href=#anime-thugs--anime-amino>Anime Thugs | Anime Amino</a></li><li><a href=#sanemi-shinazugawa-trash-gang-edit--anime-art-dark-anime-gangster>Sanemi Shinazugawa (TRASH GANG Edit) | Anime Art Dark, Anime Gangster</a></li><li><a href=#anime-thugs---unlike-many-other-websites-animekisa-has-a-tiny-amount-of-1>Anime Thugs - Unlike Many Other Websites Animekisa Has A Tiny Amount Of</a></li><li><a href=#anime-thug-life---youtube>Anime Thug Life - YouTube</a></li><li><a href=#izumi-was-molested-by-some-street-thugs---youtube--anime-manga-youtube>Izumi Was Molested By Some Street Thugs - YouTube | Anime, Manga, Youtube</a></li><li><a href=#anime-thugs--anime-amino-1>Anime Thugs | Anime Amino</a></li><li><a href=#latest--anime-thugsسفاحين-الانمي-amino>Latest | Anime Thugs|سفاحين الانمي Amino</a></li><li><a href=#beelzebub---beelzebub-wallpaper-32320691---fanpop>Beelzebub - Beelzebub Wallpaper (32320691) - Fanpop</a></li><li><a href=#tentang-best-action-anime-similar-to-naruto-tahun-ini---hademikoto>Tentang Best Action Anime Similar To Naruto Tahun Ini - Hademikoto</a></li><li><a href=#anime-thugs--just-sit-back-and-relax---river-wallpaper>Anime Thugs / Just Sit Back And Relax!
