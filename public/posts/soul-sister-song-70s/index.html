-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=hey-soul-sister---song-by-train--spotify>Hey, Soul Sister - Song By Train | Spotify<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hey-soul-sister---song-by-train--spotify>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273706a70e4bfb15d33b8ec74a1 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.dKchGzoRDdo6DZOO-M-fUgHaGe&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Hey, Soul Sister - song by Train | Spotify"><p><em>Source: open.spotify.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Conclusion
